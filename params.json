{"name":"Skwarka","tagline":"A physically based raytracer","body":"OVERVIEW\r\n========\r\n\r\nSkwarka is a research-oriented physically based raytracer inspired by the [PBRT](http://www.pbrt.org/).\r\nIt is used primarily as a test platform for global illumination algorithms and research.\r\n\r\nFEATURES\r\n========\r\n\r\nIllumination algorithms:\r\n\r\n- Direct Illumination\r\n- Photon mapping\r\n\r\nLight sources:\r\n\r\n- Point light (and the like)\r\n- Directional light\r\n- Area light (mesh-based)\r\n- Environmental light\r\n\r\nMaterials:\r\n\r\n- Matte\r\n- Plastic\r\n- Transparent\r\n- Metal\r\n- Substrate\r\n- Measured (MERL-based)\r\n\r\nSupported input formats:\r\n\r\n- PBRT scene description files\r\n\r\nGeneral:\r\n\r\n- Based on triangle meshes. The system supports a number of geometric shapes (such as spheres etc.) by triangulating them to triangle meshes.\r\n  Object instancing is supported.\r\n- Supports volumetric scattering.\r\n- Multi-threaded. The system uses the Intel TBB library to take advantage of multi-core systems.\r\n\r\nFILE STRUCTURE\r\n==============\r\n\r\n1. Source/ : The source code of the raytracer along with the MSVC project files.\r\n2. ThirdParty/ : Third-party dependency libraries. \r\n3. Binaries/ : An output directory automatically generated by the build process. Contains final binaries necessary to run the application.\r\n4. Intermediate/ : A temporary directory automatically generated by the build process. Contains intermediate binaries for the build process.\r\n\r\nSETUP AND BUILD\r\n===============\r\n\r\n1. Install MSVC version 2013 or later.\r\n2. Download third-party libraries.\r\nSome third-party libraries are not in the repository (to save space) and must be downloaded and extracted manually.\r\n    1. Boost<br/>\r\n       Download and extract boost library from the website [http://www.boost.org/](http://www.boost.org/) <br/>\r\n       The currently used version is 1.56 and it needs to be extracted to ThirdParty/boost/1.56 directory\r\n    2. TBB<br/>\r\n       Download and extract TBB library from the website [https://www.threadingbuildingblocks.org/](https://www.threadingbuildingblocks.org/) <br/>\r\n       The currently used version is 4.2 and it needs to be extracted to ThirdParty/TBB/4.2 directory\r\n3. Open Source/RayLibs/RayLibs.sln file in MSVC and it should be instantly ready for build (except for the unit tests).<br/>\r\nIf you also want to build the unit tests (the UnitTests project) you will additionally need to install Python v2.6.5 and make sure it's on your PATH env variable.\r\n\r\nLICENSE\r\n=======\r\n\r\nThe project is distributed under the GNU General Public License Version 3 - see the accompanying LICENSE file for more details.\r\n\r\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\r\n==============\r\n\r\nThe project uses the following third-party libraries:\r\n\r\n1. [Boost](http://www.boost.org/)\r\n2. [CxxTest](http://cxxtest.com/)\r\n3. [FreeImage](http://freeimage.sourceforge.net)\r\n4. [OpenEXR](http://www.openexr.com/)\r\n5.
