OVERVIEW
========

Skwarka is a research-oriented physically based raytracer inspired by the [PBRT](http://www.pbrt.org/).
It is used primarily as a test platform for global illumination algorithms and research.

FEATURES
========

Illumination algorithms:

- Direct Illumination
- Photon mapping

Light sources:

- Point light (and the like)
- Directional light
- Area light (mesh-based)
- Environmental light

Materials:

- Matte
- Plastic
- Transparent
- Metal
- Substrate
- Measured (MERL-based)

Supported input formats:

- PBRT scene description files

General:

- Based on triangle meshes. The system supports a number of geometric shapes (such as spheres etc.) by triangulating them to triangle meshes.
  Object instancing is supported.
- Supports volumetric scattering.
- Multi-threaded. The system uses the Intel TBB library to take advantage of multi-core systems.

FILE STRUCTURE
==============

1. Source/ : The source code of the raytracer along with the MSVC project files.
2. ThirdParty/ : Third-party dependency libraries. 
3. Binaries/ : An output directory automatically generated by the build process. Contains final binaries necessary to run the application.
4. Intermediate/ : A temporary directory automatically generated by the build process. Contains intermediate binaries for the build process.

SETUP AND BUILD
===============

1. Install MSVC version 2013 or later.
2. Download third-party libraries.
Some third-party libraries are not in the repository (to save space) and must be downloaded and extracted manually.
    1. Boost<br/>
       Download and extract boost library from the website [http://www.boost.org/](http://www.boost.org/) <br/>
       The currently used version is 1.56 and it needs to be extracted to ThirdParty/boost/1.56 directory
    2. TBB<br/>
       Download and extract TBB library from the website [https://www.threadingbuildingblocks.org/](https://www.threadingbuildingblocks.org/) <br/>
       The currently used version is 4.2 and it needs to be extracted to ThirdParty/TBB/4.2 directory
3. Open Source/RayLibs/RayLibs.sln file in MSVC and it should be instantly ready for build (except for the unit tests).<br/>
If you also want to build the unit tests (the UnitTests project) you will additionally need to install Python v2.6.5 and make sure it's on your PATH env variable.
